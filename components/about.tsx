        After earning my 2020 diploma in computer programming from Lambton
        College, I ventured into the unexpected realm of security guarding. It
        was during this time that my interest in programming took root and
        blossomed. While patrolling, I found myself drawn to the world of
        coding, and I began self-learning with determination. Armed with online
        resources and documentation, I delved into the art of programming,
        crafting projects that ignited my problem-solving skills. Today, I'm
        equipped with a diverse skill set, ready to channel my programming
        passion into impactful solutions.
